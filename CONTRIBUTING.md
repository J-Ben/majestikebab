Project MAJESTIC Kebab
Files Structure
The structure of the project is quite simple, in the src folder, you will find a component folder, pages folder, donnee folder, images folder and model folder.

Where to start
You can start by the App.js file where all the main functions and the states are. In this file you will see functions that are used or passed on to other components that need them. There is a state for each component which is a boolean and determines what component is visible and what is not.
